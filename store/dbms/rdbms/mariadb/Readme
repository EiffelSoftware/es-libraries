The MARIADB class is the database specification file. 
An instance of this class is used as generic parameter in EiffelStore.

On Windows
----------
You need to have $(MARIADB) in your environment, set to the directory where the MariaDB (or MySQL) C Connector is installed.
(i.e, directory containing the mysql "include" folder).

On Linux
--------
The package "mariadb" is required (including the `mariadb_config` tool)

For instance, on debian:
- To install the needed MariaDB packages:
	apt-get install libmariadb-dev
